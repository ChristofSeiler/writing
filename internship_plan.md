# Internship Plan

* What is the data?
* What's the dimensionality of the data? How many features (columns), how many observations (rows)?
* What is the structure of the data? Are the features strongly correlated? Are the observations clusteredâ€”maybe because you have multiple observations per company? 
* What statistics / machine learning models are you going to apply? For example: Predict vector y from matrix X using random forests.
* How are you going to find hyperparameters of your models? Do you have enough data to do cross-validation?
* How are you going to assess uncertainty in your estimates? Bootstrap? Prediction intervals?
