# Scientific Writing

## Rules

* cut the clutter
* write in active voice
* avoid turning verbs into nouns
* choose strong verbs
* get to the main verb of a sentence quickly
* it is really OK to use "We" and "I"
* use parallelisms
* each paragraph should have one idea in it

## Process

1. write down all your ideas---usually not very readable
2. pretend that you are the editor and clean up the text
3. iterate steps 2 many times

Important note: It's OK if the text is not consistent after an iteration. You will fix it in the next iteration.
