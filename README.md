# Scientific Writing

## Rules

* cut the clutter
* write in active voice
* avoid turning verbs into nouns
* choose strong verbs
* get to the main verb of a sentence quickly
* it is really OK to use "We" and "I"
* use parallelisms
* each paragraph should have one idea in it

## Process

1. write down all your ideas---usually not very readable
2. pretend that you are the editor and clean up the text
3. iterate step 2 two many times

Important note: It's OK if the text is not consistent after an iteration. You will fix it in the next iteration.

# Internship/Thesis Plan

* What is the data?
* What's the dimensionality of the data? How many features (columns), how many observations (rows)?
* What is the structure of the data? Are the features strongly correlated? Are the observations clusteredâ€”maybe because you have multiple observations per company? 
* What statistics / machine learning models are you going to apply? For example: Predict vector y from matrix X using random forests.
* How are you going to find hyperparameters of your models? Do you have enough data to do cross-validation?
* How are you going to assess uncertainty in your estimates? Bootstrap? Prediction intervals?
